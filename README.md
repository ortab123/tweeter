## Tweeter 🐦

A simplified Twitter-like application built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery.  
Users can create posts ("twits"), comment on them, and delete both posts and comments — all rendered dynamically in the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Add new posts (twits)
- 💬 Add comments to each post
- ❌ Delete posts and individual comments
- ⚡ Real-time updates without refreshing
- ✨ Smooth animations and UI feedback for better UX
- 📦 Modular code using the MVC architecture

## 🧠 Project Structure (MVC)

| Module     | File        | Responsibility                                      |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Model      | `model.js`  | Data handling (posts, comments, ID generation)      |
| View       | `render.js` | DOM rendering and layout creation                   |
| Controller | `main.js`   | Event handling, DOM interaction, data → view bridge |
